## React native architecture boilerplate

In this repo, I tried to create an frontend architecture which follow the S.O.L.I.D principles and clean architecture.


```
config
modules
|---module1
|---|----feature1
|---|----feature2
|---|----|----infra/
|---|----|----presentation/
|---|----|----services/
|---module2
|---module3   
shared

```

Each folder has your description, go ahead and look around ⬆️
