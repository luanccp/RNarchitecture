## Here we have our business rules.

----
Pure TS files without global state management influences and strict connected with the high order module, in this case: **User**.

Respecting the SRP principle:

### **S**RP: The Single Responsibility Principle

> A function should do one, and only one, thing.

Each service must have a test file.
